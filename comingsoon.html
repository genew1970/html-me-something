    <article><img class="first"><img class="poster" src="images/lastjedi.jpg" alt="logan">Rogue One is an action-packed movie for all ages.  In my opinion, Rogue One ranks just below Empire Strikes Back (number one) in
    my personal ranking.  The story does have a few slow spots.  Rogue One is entertaining and should hit the stores on DVD/Blu-ray April 4th.  It will be available
    digitally March 24th.<br><b>Premise</b>: A band of mercenaries set out to steal the plans to the Death Star.
    <br> <b>Pros</b>: Felicity Jones is phenomenal in Rogue One.  Donnie Yen brings martial arts to the Star Wars universe.  K2SO is a great robot companion!  I want one!<br><b>Cons</b>: The slow parts of the
    movie break up the action sequences in a reasonable manner.  Some scenes were a bit too slow. Cassian could have used some back story to help identify with the character.
    <br><br>
    <b>Final verdict</b>:  4.5/5 </article>

  <img class="poster" src="images/guardian2poster.jpg" alt="batman">The Lego Batman movie is a "fun for the family" movie.  There are plenty of laughs throughout the movie.  In fact, the sound effects for
    the movie almost had me in tears from laughter.  The script is good and the violence is minimal.  As a Batman fan, I found it a good alternative
    from the traditional "dark" themed Batman movies.  <br><b>Premise</b>:  Batman takes on an orphan as a son.  The world is threatened, once again, by villanous characters.
    <br><b>Pros</b>:  The acting, animation and script are spot on.  <br><b>Cons</b>: None.  <br><br><b>Final verdict</b>: 5/5
