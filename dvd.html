    <article><img class="poster" src="images/rogueone.jpg" alt="logan"><center><h2>Rogue One</h2></center>Rogue One is an action-packed movie for all ages.  In my opinion, Rogue One ranks just below Empire Strikes Back (number one) in
    my personal ranking.  The story does have a few slow spots.  Rogue One is entertaining and should hit the stores on DVD/Blu-ray April 4th.  It will be available
    digitally March 24th.<br><b>Premise</b>: A band of mercenaries set out to steal the plans to the Death Star.
    <br> <b>Pros</b>: Felicity Jones is phenomenal in Rogue One.  Donnie Yen brings martial arts to the Star Wars universe.  K2SO is a great robot companion!  I want one!<br><b>Cons</b>: The slow parts of the
    movie break up the action sequences in a reasonable manner.  Some scenes were a bit too slow. Cassian could have used some back story to help identify with the character.

    <b class="final">Final verdict</b>:  4.5/5 </article>

  <img class="poster" src="images/fantasticbeasts.jpg" alt="batman"><center><h2>Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them</h2></center>
    Fantastic Beasts is a movie spawned from the Harry Potter universe which provides entertainment throughout the movie.
    The movie is light-hearted with plenty of laughs for kids and adults alike.  My wife has not seen a single Harry Potter movie
    and did not require explanations.  This is good news for those individuals who have not seen the movies. <br><b>Premise</b>:
    The main character is tracking down some lost beasts as the characters explore a wonderful world of fantasy.
    <br><b>Pros</b>:  The movie provides lots of laughs and is easy to follow.  Eddie Redmayne provides a brilliant performance as the lead character.
    <br><b>Cons</b>: It seemed some characters needed a bit more explanation.  <br><br><b class="final">Final verdict</b>: 4.5/5
