      Hello!  My name is Alfred Williams.  I am a passionate fan of video games and movies.  The first video game I played was Pong for the <b>Atari 2600</b>.  Shortly after,
      I purchased an <b>Intellivision</b> game console.  My favorite game on this console is <b>Tron Deadly Discs</b>.  The video game crash kept me wondering when the next "big thing"
      would be released in the realm of video game consoles.  Soon after, <b>Nintendo</b> and <b>Sega</b> were competing for the top spot in video game consoles sold.  While some players
      sought to argue one system was better than another, I purchased both systems.  In my opinion, the games help the company sell systems.  There are numerous good games
      available on several platforms, including PC's.
      <br><br>
      The first movie I absolutely fell in love with is <b>Star Wars: A New Hope</b>.  I have seen several movies on the big screen, including some old <b>Godzilla</b> movies released in
      the early to mid 1970's.  However, the movie effects used in Star Wars gave this movie an addition dimension of realism.  The techniques have advanced over the years
      and <b>ILM</b> (Industrial Light & Magic) have incorperated digital effects that are top of the line.  Though there is some debate around the use of the digital reproduction
      of Govenor Tarkin and Princess Leia in Rogue One, <b>ILM</b> has "taken a big step into a larger world."
